# 🕵️‍♀️ Image Steganography GUI using Python

A simple Python-based GUI application that allows you to hide (encode) secret text messages inside images and retrieve (decode) them — using the Least Significant Bit (LSB) steganography technique.

This project was developed as part of my **IBM Cybersecurity Internship (AICTE SkillBuild)**.

## 📌 Features

✅ User-friendly GUI using Tkinter  
✅ Hide messages inside `.jpg` or `.png` images  
✅ Extract hidden messages from encoded images  
✅ No visual change in image after encoding  
✅ No external APIs — works fully offline

## 🎯 Real-World Application in Cybersecurity

Steganography is often used for:
- Covert communication in espionage
- Hiding malware payloads inside images
- Sending secure messages without drawing attention
- Teaching data hiding and steganalysis in cybersecurity
